                As a Masters in Computer Science student at the University of Florida and a Full Stack Developer with
                over 3 years of industry experience, my passion for creating impactful software solutions is fueled by a
                strong foundation in JavaScript, CSS, and Java.<br><br>

                During my tenure as a Senior Software Engineer at ValueLabs, I contributed to significant enhancements
                of the EdTech platform named Pearson, including developing responsive UIs and efficient server-side APIs
                using React JS and Node.js. Notably, I was instrumental in optimizing component logic to boost rendering
                performance by 15%.<br><br>

                At the University of Florida, I honed my skills as a React Native Developer, developing an iOS
                application for patients with movement disorders. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as
                MediaPipeâ€™s Hand Landmarks and Pose machine learning models, I designed features that increased feedback
                precision and exercise effectiveness by 30%.<br><br>

                Earlier in my career, I designed an Android app aimed at facilitating communication between blood donors
                and recipients, focusing on secure and accurate user data handling using SQL databases and RESTful
                APIs.<br><br>

                I am Open to new opportunities where I can bring my Full Stack expertise and passion for problem-solving
                to drive innovation and promote organizational growth.<br><br>
